# Personal Website 

## Introduction

This file serves as documentation for the implementation of my personal website. The purpose of this website will be to present my skills as a full-stack developer, as well as potentially other functionality such as a blog in the future. 

## Analysis

### Technologies

This website will be written using the MERN stack. 

I could either use bootstrap or learn a CSS pre-processor for the layout like SASS/LESS. I'm thinking bootstrap for the layout with SASS for the styling is probably the best option. 

The website will be hosted on github pages, with the database and backend hosted on mongoDB's servers and heroku respectively.

### Inspiration

I like the way that, when scrolling, different elements animate at different speeds. I also like the on-hover button animations. I could include something more simple in my website, such as a button animating slightly up when hovered over.

I like the simple art on this website, I feel like an art style like this would be easier to aim towards. I like that it is all one page.

I like how this website speaks to the person reading it rather than just providing information.

I like this one due to how simple it is, it provides just enough information.

### Colour scheme

I am going for a blue colour scheme, thanks coolors.co!

Colours are as follows:
Gunmetal: 253237
Cadet: 5C6B73
Pewter Blue: 9DB4C0
Powder Blue: C2DFE3
Light Cyan: E0FBFC


### Layout

I want a nice animation when switching between the three pages, could do this instead of the scrolling

Layout designs are present in my notepad (uploaded images pending)

## Implementation

I started by reminding myself of react. 

I then used create-react-app to create an app skeleton which I will build upon.
