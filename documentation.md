# Personal Website 

## Introduction

This file serves as documentation for the implementation of my personal website. The purpose of this website will be to present my skills as a full-stack developer, as well as potentially other functionality such as a blog in the future. 

## Analysis

### Technologies

This website will be written using the MERN stack. 

I could either use bootstrap of learn a CSS pre-processor for the layout like SASS/LESS. I'm thinking bootstrap for the layout with SASS for the styling. 

The website will be hosted on github pages, with the database and backend hosted on mongoDB's servers and heroku.

### Inspiration

I like the way that, when scrolling, different elements animate at different speeds. I also like the on-hover button animations. I could include something more simple in my website, such as a button animating slightly up when hovered over.

I like the simple art on this website, I feel like an art style like this would be easier to aim towards. I like that it is all one page.

I like how this website speaks to the person reading it rather than just providing information.

I like this one due to how simple it is, it provides just enough information.
